# Phased-nf
Generate phased scaffolded genome assemblies with PacBio Hifi + Hi-C reads. 

## Run the pipeline
The easiest way to run the pipeline is to make a copy of `template_config`, fill in the paths (make sure you enclose them in 'single quotes'), and rename the config as `nextflow.config`. Once you're done making the nextflow config file, run the pipeline with nextflow: `nextflow run main.nf`.
